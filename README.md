# BNPL
# Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) DApp

## Project Description

A decentralized Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) system that allows users to purchase goods/services with deferred payments, recorded transparently on the blockchain. Merchants can add purchase agreements, and users can repay at a later date using smart contracts.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize credit-based purchases by creating a transparent, trustless, and decentralized BNPL mechanism using blockchain technology, making credit access safer and more inclusive.

## Key Features

- **Smart Purchase Recording**: Only the merchant (contract owner) can record BNPL purchases.
- **Secure Repayment**: Buyers can repay their deferred payments directly on-chain.
- **Decentralization**: No third-party financial institutions needed â€” trust is encoded into the contract.

## Future Scope

- Integrate with NFTs to tokenize purchase agreements.
- Implement credit scoring and limit system.
- Allow partial repayments and set due dates with penalties.
- Integrate frontend UI for seamless DApp experience.
- Connect with oracles for fiat-to-crypto conversions.
